I've used an Apple computer exclusively since 2005. (I did try a Microsoft Surface 3 - it lasted less than a month.)  I'm a very big fan of Apple's software and the \"mac\" way of doing things.  But no one gets it right all the time, and when Apple gets it wrong, boy do they get it wrong.\n\nAs I'm writing this, I'm using my wife's Magic Mouse.  The Magic Mouse is probably the worst thing Apple has ever made.  It's ergonomics are so wrong that it hurts me to use it for more than five minutes.  It's too low to the desk and it's weird touch gestures which seem so natural on a trackpad, almost never get used on a tiny mouse.\n","featured_image":[{"id":"attkdOneDrThytupv","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/LFvyn2nnQm6vTxIKphMG_Psalms.jpg","filename":"Psalms.jpg","size":502160,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/ON3EFJsTRQuCkLKgSEs4_small_Psalms.jpg","width":64,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/3bvOdO74QOS6MKzXjUly_large_Psalms.jpg","width":512,"height":512}}}],"categories":["News"],"author":["recqUg9dVzgaAzFw4"],"date_added":"2016-07-06","published":true,"author_name":["Sample Author"],"author_bio":["Pastor Tommy McMurtry was saved at an early age, and was raised in a pastor's home his entire life.
